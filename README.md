This project has old commits from when it was hosted on Glitch, however there is a large time gap in which I switched to self hosting before properly learning to use GitHub. I have maintained this project since high school, so I simply didn't know any better about tracking its progress back then.

The bot token isn't here, and with each commit i will also empty the user database json file for the sake of those users' privacy.
